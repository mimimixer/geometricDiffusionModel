# Generating geometrical shapes with AI models
### Exploring the latent space of VAE, GAN and Diffusion models

* create your dataset with: generateGeometricShapes.py

- chose your model, type in the folder with your dataset, and train: 
    - for VAE with cnn use cnnVAEtrain.py
    - for GAN use GAN.py
    - for diffusion use diffusion5.py

Other possibilities to combine fc-VAE with one layer in /VAE/fcVAEmodel.py or with more layers in VAEmodel.py are also there and can be trained with VAEtrain.py and inference with VAEgenerator.py and visualisation with visualizeVAE.py.
